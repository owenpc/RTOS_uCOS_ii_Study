Okay, I am not really that bored to actually write instructions on codes which I have uploaded on GitHub. Sorry for that, BTW. Anyway if you are really interested in knowing how the codes work or how to implement them, shoot me an email at adityakamath.rm@gmail.com or adityakamath@live.com. Besides, the description should have already given you a general idea about what the codes are all about anyway. 

Cheers!
Aditya Kamath
